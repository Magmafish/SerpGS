The sac spider is commonly found in homes and is often mistaken for the brown recluse because it is similar in shape, but the sac spider lacks the “fiddle” pattern of the brown recluse.

Although the bite of a yellow sac spider can be painful, it is not medically significant except for allergic individuals.
