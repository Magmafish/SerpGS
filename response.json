          'text': ' A bedroom table lamp sets the mood for your bedroom and illuminates reading and task work. These should be 24–27 tall for optimal bedtime reading. Light your living room and create an inviting atmosphere with the right table lamp. The ideal lamp size for a living room table lamp is 24–34 tall. Task desk lighting can help bring specific areas into focus, while a taller lamp can brighten a larger area. Desk lamps can range in size from 12–30 high. These small (less than 24 tall) lamps soften the overall light in a room and draw attention to objects nearby. They’re perfect for entryways or living rooms. Add warmth & light to any space with a table lamp. As easy addition, lamps help set the right ambiance for every type of room. Living rooms require soft lighting to create an inviting atmosphere for your guests. Accent lamps not only brighten up the room but also double up as decor for your living room. The base and shade complement each other making them a great decor accessory. They are perfect for your entryway table or living rooms. Based on your decor style, find a variety of designs, from modern to bohemian, or go rustic with a farmhouse-inspired lamp. If you are looking to mix-n-match, pick your favorite lamp base available in a range of materials, from glass to wood and shiny metallic finishes. The size, material, and shape of the shade also determine the amount of illumination. For bedrooms, the lighting is softer to set the right mood for relaxation or light reading. A table lamp for the bedroom helps illuminate for reading and task work but is softer than a desk lamp. Task desk lamps are great for your study table or work desk as they focus light on a specific area.'
