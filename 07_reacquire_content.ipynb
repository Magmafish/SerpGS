      "A bedroom table lamp sets the mood for your bedroom and illuminates reading and task work. These should be 24\"–27\" tall for optimal bedtime reading. Light your living room and create an inviting atmosphere with the right table lamp. The ideal lamp size for a living room table lamp is 24\"–34\" tall. Task desk lighting can help bring specific areas into focus, while a taller lamp can brighten a larger area. Desk lamps can range in size from 12\"–30\" high. These small (less than 24\" tall) lamps soften the overall light in a room and draw attention to objects nearby. They’re perfect for entryways or living rooms. Add warmth & light to any space with a table lamp. As easy addition, lamps help set the right ambiance for every type of room. Living rooms require soft lighting to create an inviting atmosphere for your guests. Accent lamps not only brighten up the room but also double up as decor for your living room. The base and shade complement each other making them a great decor accessory. They are perfect for your entryway table or living rooms. Based on your decor style, find a variety of designs, from modern to bohemian, or go rustic with a farmhouse-inspired lamp. If you are looking to mix-n-match, pick your favorite lamp base available in a range of materials, from glass to wood and shiny metallic finishes. The size, material, and shape of the shade also determine the amount of illumination. For bedrooms, the lighting is softer to set the right mood for relaxation or light reading. A table lamp for the bedroom helps illuminate for reading and task work but is softer than a desk lamp. Task desk lamps are great for your study table or work desk as they focus light on a specific area. \n"

Family Handyman An edging tool gives the concrete a round edge. Family Handyman A groover makes joints in the concrete to control cracking. Family Handyman A float compacts the concrete surface, giving it a smooth look.\\xa0Putting a smooth, durable finish on concrete is a skill you can only master with the proper set of tools and practice. We’ll show you the tools and how to use them for each step of the concrete finishing process. And equally important, we’ll help you determine when the concrete is ready for the next finishing step. But you really can’t practice these techniques except on real concrete. So it’s smart to start with a small project like this garbage can pad. When you get the hang of it, you can move up to a larger slab. But keep in mind that finishing larger slabs (more than about 100 sq. ft.) is trickier because the concrete may set up too fast. In this article, we’ll show you how to level the concrete in the forms, round over the edges and make a progressively smoother finish. But we won’t show how to build forms or fill them with concrete. Each step in the process requires a different tool. You can make the screed (Photo 1) and darby (Photo 2) from scraps of wood. The rest you’ll have to rent or buy. You’ll need a magnesium float ($15 to $25), an edger ($5 to $20), a grooving tool ($10 to $30) and a steel trowel ($8 to $40). Pros buy expensive top-quality tools that will stand up to the rigors of daily use, but less expensive versions are available at home centers and hardware stores and will work fine for occasional home use. Concrete is a blend of Portland cement, sand, aggregate (gravel) and water that harden when mixed. While there are additives that can slow down or speed up the process, and special bagged mixes that set fast, in general, the speed of the process largely depends on the temperature and humidity. Hot, dry weather accelerates the hardening process, sometimes so much that it’s nearly impossible to complete all the finishing steps in time. Work while your project is in shade if possible. On cool days, you may spend a lot of time waiting for the concrete to reach the next stage. That’s why we can’t give you exact waiting times. But we’ll show you how to tell when the concrete is ready for each finishing step. Family Handyman Push or pull the screed board across the forms with a back-and-forth sawing motion. Shove concrete into low spots in front of the screed board. Repeat to remove excess concrete. Form and Pour a Concrete Slab Family Handyman Sweep the darby across the concrete in overlapping arcs to flatten the surface, push down lumps and fill voids. Lift the leading edge slightly but keep the darby level with the surface. Make two passes. How to Pour a Concrete Slab Successfully: 31 Tips Family Handyman Water will appear on the surface. Wait until this “bleed” water and sheen disappear entirely before edging, jointing or floating the concrete.\\xa0Screeding levels the concrete with the top of the forms and begins the process of forcing the larger aggregate below the surface. Use any 2×4 that overlaps the forms by at least 6 in., but make sure it’s straight (Photo 1). Follow screeding immediately with the darby (Photo 2). Your goal is to level out marks and fill small holes left by screeding. In the process, you’ll force larger aggregate down, leaving a slurry of cement and sand to fill the surface. The darby should be large enough to reach a little more than halfway across the slab. Make a darby by screwing a handle (we cut a 2×4 with a jigsaw to make a handle) onto a straight piece of 1×4. Longer darbies may require two handles for better control. If you can’t reach the entire slab from the edges with a darby, rent a bull float and handle to use instead. Two passes over the surface with the darby are enough. Overworking the concrete will draw too much cement and fine sand to the top and create a weak surface. Drilling Concrete and Installing Fasteners Family Handyman Work the edging tool back and forth, using the edge of the form as a guide. Lift the leading edge slightly. Use long strokes, working the aggregate back until you have smooth, round edges. Family Handyman Set a straight board along predetermined marks for control joints. Run the groover back and forth against the straightedge until the bed of the tool is riding on the concrete surface.\\xa0After smoothing the slab with the darby, water will “bleed” out of the concrete and sit on the surface (Photo 3). This is temporary. It’ll soon reabsorb into the concrete. However, it’s critical to wait until it disappears. Working the concrete before the surface “bleed” water disappears will weaken the surface of the slab when it dries. When all traces of the water are gone and the concrete starts to harden, you can resume finishing activities. Test by pressing your gloved thumb onto the surface near the perimeter. The concrete is ready when pressing hard only leaves a 1/4-in. deep impression. Start by running the edger around the perimeter to round and compact the corner (Photo 4). Sometimes it’s a little tough at first as you push larger aggregate back into the concrete and round over the edge. If the edger is leaving a path deeper than about 1/8 in., wait for the concrete to set a little longer and apply less downward pressure. Next divide the slab into equal parts with a straightedge and groover (Photo 5). Sidewalks and small slabs need grooves about every 4 ft. Add grooves every 10 or 12 ft. on driveways and garage slabs. Dividing slabs with grooves looks nice, but the real reason is to control cracking. Drying and soil movement cause concrete to crack. The groove creates a weakened spot for the crack to form where it won’t be seen. To be effective, the groove must be at least one-fourth the depth of the slab. Family Handyman Lift the leading edge slightly while you sweep the magnesium concrete hand float over the concrete in large arcs to compact the surface. Blend in the marks left by the edges of the edger and groover. How to Remove and Replace a Small Concrete Entry Pad Family Handyman Smooth the surface with a steel trowel after it’s partially hardened. Hold the trowel almost flat and swing it in large overlapping arcs while applying pressure.\\xa0Float the concrete when you’re done grooving and edging (Photo 6). Floating removes the marks left by edging and brings the surface one step closer to a final finish. You may have to bear down on the float if the concrete is starting to harden. You’ll be surprised that with enough scrubbing you’ll be able to bring a slurry to the surface of even a fairly hard slab. If you’re happy with the look of your floated slab, you don’t need to do any more finishing. Repeat the edging and grooving steps after floating and after troweling to refine the groove and edges. For a decorative border effect similar to what’s shown in the inset to Photo 4, run the edger around each section of slab after a final broom finish. In Photo 7, we show how to put an even, smooth finish on the slab with a steel trowel. Troweling is one of the trickier steps in concrete finishing. You’ll have to practice to develop a feel for it. For a really smooth finish, repeat the troweling step two or three times, letting the concrete harden a bit between each pass. At first, hold the trowel almost flat, elevating the leading edge just enough to avoid gouging the surface. On each successive pass, lift the leading edge of the trowel a little more. If you want a rougher, non-slip surface, you can skip this step and do a broom finish (Photo 8). Also, if you order air-entrained concrete delivered, don’t trowel the surface. How to Properly Mix Concrete Drag a broom across the concrete after floating it with the magnesium float to create a non-slip surface. Adjust the downward pressure to create the desired amount of texture.\\xa0Dragging a broom across partially hardened concrete leaves a rough texture that gives better traction in slippery conditions (Photo 8). Special concrete brooms are available, but a regular push broom will work too. Remember to wash off the bristles as soon as you finish brooming concrete. As with all the other finishing steps, the key to a successful broom finish is to wait until the concrete surface is just right. If concrete starts to pile up in front of the bristles as you drag the broom across, resmooth the broomed area with a float or trowel and then wait a little longer before trying again. When you’re done finishing the concrete, cover it with plastic or keep it moist by sprinkling it several times a day for about a week. This slows the curing process and results in a stronger, more durable slab. It might be hard to believe that concrete can be dangerous. But the strong alkalinity of cement can cause chemical burns just like a strong acid. By the time you realize you’re being burned, you may already have skin damage. That’s why it’s essential to prevent prolonged skin exposure to wet concrete. And why you should be extra careful to keep wet concrete from getting in your eyes. Wear rubber gloves, a long-sleeve shirt, long pants and safety glasses. Wear rubber boots if you’ll be wading in concrete. Rinse wet concrete from your skin immediately and remove clothes that have become saturated with concrete.

Here's what you need to know to shape and smooth fresh concrete into an attractive, long-lasting surface. Try to move quickly except where noted otherwise so you can finish before the concrete dries, especially on a hot day.  If you've already poured and leveled your concrete, begin the finishing process by moving a rounded bull float over the concrete to smooth out the surface. For small projects, you can use a magnesium float instead. Then, use an edging tool to tidy up the edges and corners of your concrete by moving in a back-and-forth motion as this will make the concrete more durable. Finish by cutting grooves at intervals in your concrete before it dries to reduce the risk of cracking in the future.

You probably didn’t pay a lot of attention but you noticed someone down on their hands and knees with a trowel moving around the concrete surface. Like everything else that is done by someone with experience, it looked easy. Guess what? It’s not that easy unless you have done some homework. Sakrete is here to provide you those tips and instructions on how to finish concrete like a pro. After thoroughly mixing the concrete pour it into the forms slightly overfilling them. Then take a straight board (a 2x4 piece of lumber works great as long as it isn’t bowed) and simply level off the concrete. Using a board that is longer than your pour is wide and using a sawing motion work back and forth until the concrete is level. You really need someone on the other side to help with this part. This is called “screeding” if you are trying to learn new words with which to impress your friends. If you haven’t done this before or only done it a few times you are likely to make two mistakes; troweling too soon and troweling too much. Both of these have the effect of pulling fines and water to the surface. This can lead to a weakened surface, tiny cracks and a white dusty surface. Then with a wooden trowel or magnesium float if you want to get fancy, smooth off the surface. This should only take a few minutes. Do not try to turn this into a masterpiece-leave that for art class. This step is simply to put a relatively smooth surface on the concrete. When you are done, go clean your mixer and tools and get something to drink. Keep an eye on the concrete. The first thing you will notice is that some bleed water will come to the surface. This is a good thing. Allow all of the water to disappear before you do anything else. This can take 20 minutes or 4 hours depending on the temperature, humidity and how hard the wind is blowing. After the bleed water is all gone you can get out your steel finishing trowel and put on the final touches. You will notice the steel trowel is not perfectly flat. That is done so that when you trowel you will be more prone to lift the leading edge slightly avoiding digging into the concrete.  Even by following my outstanding instructions it is doubtful that your surface will look a pro did it. As I said in the beginning, using a trowel isn’t all that easy. However, most of us are good with a broom. If your mother brought you up right, you’ve had lots of practice. Once you are finished with the trowel, simply take a soft broom and gently drag it across the surface. Always pull the broom (never push) and always go in the same direction. Just one pass should do the trick. I personally prefer a broom finish because it makes the surface slightly rougher. This is very helpful for those occasions when your sidewalk is wet. A hard troweled surface is very slick. Unless your brother-in-law is a really good lawyer, you don’t want someone take a tumble on your property. Concrete Repair is never fun. \\xa0Besides this way everyone will think you really knew what you doing and you won’t have to tell them about the broom trick.  Don’t stop reading yet or you will miss one very important point. You need to “cure” the concrete. If the concrete isn’t kept moist for a few days it may crack. The problem is that the surface will dry out while the bottom is still wet causing tension which basically tears the concrete apart. There are several ways to cure concrete. The easiest is to simply spray it very lightly with a hose. You can cover it with a wet cloth such as burlap (don’t let the burlap dry out). Or you can use chemical curing agents such as Sakrete Cure `N Seal. The question of how long to do this and how often is a tough one because it depends on temperature, humidity and air flow. The hotter and dryer and windier it is the more you will have to re apply water. Bob Schmidt Product Manager Sakrete of North America Did you make this project? Share it with us!                                                                7 years ago                     on Step 4 Thank you for this instructable. I learned not to play with it too much as this what my problem was last time. I am going to have a go at this project again.                                                                10 years ago                     on Introduction At times, I like the \"exposed aggregate look\". But how and when to do this is \" touchy\" no?                                                                12 years ago                     on Introduction Thank you for your series in making concrete projects.  Every now and then someone wants to make a casting project with a concrete and a mold.  Sometimes the \"top\" of the final project will be the shape of the mold (flipped over after curing) and sometimes the top will be the top surface of the dried concrete.  Do you have recommendations for making smooth surfaces when casting flat or curved concrete?  The projects I\\'m thinking of would be smooth enough to apply wax for a perfect shine.                                                 Reply                                          12 years ago                     on Introduction As you well know concrete mixes are usually very porous once they set and that is mainly due to the gravel aggregate in the mix. The top of the mold area can easily be floated or troweled to a somewhat smooth surface but the bottom of the mold is much harder to control. The aggregate will fall to the bottom of the mold. My suggestion would be to allow for the top of the molded concrete to be the top of the project piece as it is the only side you can consistently control the surface of. If it is necessary for the bottom to be used as the top of the project, you may want to look into using an additional resurfacing material which dosen\\'t contain the large aggregate such as the Sakrete Top N Bond Concrete Patcher. The\\xa0patcher can be used once the concrete piece is set enough so that it is undisturbed when applying the Top N Bond.\\xa0Hope this helps..The Sakrete Team © 2023 Autodesk, Inc.

If you are using wheelbarrows to move the concrete from the truck to the forms, make sure you have enough help to finish the project in a timely manner. Concrete delivery should be closely coordinated with placing and finishing operations. Concrete should not be poured faster than it can be worked – spreading, consolidating, bull floating. Instead, concrete should be poured continuously as near as possible to its final position. You should never dump concrete into separate piles and work together. Placing concrete in forms and then consolidating is popular for some types of construction (i.e. Pouring Formed Columns, Beams Etc.). The consolidation process uses vibration and gravity to compact fresh concrete within the forms and around embedded items and reinforcement. This process eliminates unwanted pockets of trapped air, honeycomb, and stone while maintaining significant amounts of entrained air. The vibration temporarily suspends the natural friction between the aggregate particles, causing the concrete to behave as a liquid. Internal friction resumes as the vibration is stopped. Vibrators can be found at most rental supply stores. When pouring concrete into ICF’s (insulating Concrete Forms) we do not recommend using Pencil Vibrators, instead use a wall banger for consolidation. ICF’s are poured in 4’ lifts, if you use a pencil vibrator you risk re-liquefying the lifts below. This will increase the pressure at the bottom of the forms and risk a blow out. Visible concrete slabs used for driveways, patios, etc. will often need finishing. You can finish your concrete in many ways, including color tinting, texturing, and Patterned-stamped finishes. These are considered advanced finishing techniques and will only be covered briefly in this section. Some surfaces may require just strike off and screeding to proper contour and elevation. Others will require a broomed, troweled or floated finish. In this section we will take you step-by-step through the process. Strike off operation is key the achieving a true plane surface. A screed is the tool used to accomplish this task often made of wood (2” x 4” Lumber), magnesium, or aluminum. Because the tool is called a screed this process is often referred to as screeding. “Screeding” is most commonly used word to describe this process in this area. Screeding is the process of cutting off excess concrete to bring the top surface of the slab to proper grade. The screed should be 1 1/2’ – 2’ longer than the slab is wide so that it always rides on the forms. A straight edge is moved across the concrete with a sawing motion and progresses forward a short distance with each movement. The screed should be tilted slightly toward the operator so that there is a single cutting edge. To fill in low points keep approximately 1 inch of concrete rolling in front of the straight edge. Remove excess concrete with a flat shovel or a hoe-like tool called a come-along. Frequently two passes with the screed is necessary to achieve desired grade. If you are going to be pouring a large slab with a width of 15’ feet or greater it becomes difficult to strike off this much concrete. Even at fifteen feet you will need three people working the screed. At this point instead of relying solely on the side forms temporary pipe, or rails can be used. The use of grade stakes placed throughout the pouring area will help give the crew reference points to level the slab as they go. If you drive the grade stakes in far enough to accommodate the temporary rail and still be at desired grade this system works very well. Use metal grade stakes so you can pull them up or bend them over as they are no longer need. I have seen many crews that have been pouring for years only use grade stakes and forgo the rails. There are hand-drawn and power drawn vibrating screeds that can be used to strike off and consolidate the concrete at the same time. They can be ordered with single beam, double beam, or truss type straight edges. Bull Floats and darbies serve the same purpose however, daries are typically use for small areas. Both are used to eliminates high and low spots, and to slightly embed large aggregate particles immediately after strike off. These floats will also work up more paste to the top of the slab to help in finishing later. Bull floats\\xa0are large, long handled floats that are used while standing. There long extendable handles are used for reaching across large slabs. Bull Float blades are usually 8” wide and 3’ – 8’ long and come with a fix head or pivoting head. Fix head bull floats require the finished to lower the handle thus lifting the front of the blade as he pushes it across the surface, then he must lift the handle to raise the other side of the blade on the return. The distance that the float can effectively be used is limit by the reach of the finisher. The alternative is using a pivoting blade head. By rotating the handle the finisher can raise and lower the blade allowing the finisher to reach much farther. (Note: when adding on additional screw in handles to reach farther distances beware of overhead power lines) Darbies are held in the hand, while the finisher kneels on knee boards. Darbies range in length from 28” – 45” long, and the width tapers from 2 ½” – 3 ½” at the handle. The longer Darbies will have two or three handles for better control. Bull Floats are made of Wood, Aluminum, or Magnesium. Darbies are made of wood and Magnesium. Wood Darbies and Bull Floats are used on slab that are not air-entrained or slab that have slumps of less than 4”. The wood grains texture makes them least likely to seal the surface before bleedwater has a chance to bleed off and dissipate.\\xa0 Start bull floating or using the darbie immediately after the strike-off and finish before the bleed water appears. If possible have a finisher follow the strike-off crew with the bull float. If you are limited on help, stop every few yards and bull float the slab as you go. When bull floating pass the float across the slab perpendicular to the direction of the strike-off. Keep the leading edge of the bull float slightly elevated so that it does not dig in to the slab. Avoid creating high spots near the edge of the forms by bring the bull float blade all the way to the edge of the form. Use a hand held float to go back and float around the edges. If low spots remain add concrete to that area and float again. Note: Do not over float the surface. Do not slop the cream off the sides of the forms: you will need this later for finishing. When using the\\xa0Darbie, hold it flat against the surface and work in a sawing motion across the slab. Keep Darbie as flat as possible to keep from sealing the surface. When the surface is level, tilt the Darbie slightly and sweep it across the surface to fill small impressions left by the sawing motion. You do not need to wait for bleed water to evaporate on the first pass of the Bull Float or Darbie. On some slabs all that may be required is one pass of the bull float; however on most slabs additional finishing will be required.\\xa0 Before any further finishing is started, the finisher must wait for the bleedwater to evaporate. Finishing while bleedwater is present can cause crazing, dusting, or scaling. Sprinkling water on top of the slab or adding straight Portland to the surface to dry up water will also cause serious problems. Don’t start to finish until, when you push on the surface with your finger you only leave a ¼” deep impression. Edging is usually only needed on sidewalks, driveways and steps. Edging is not required on slabs, and should not be done on floors that will be covered with tile. Edging will compact the concrete next to the form where floating and troweling are less effective. This will make the edge of the slab more durable and less likely to chip. Edging tools have a curved lip that forms the edge. These curved lips range in depth from 1/8” -1 ½” and in radius from 1/8” – 1”. For Driveway, sidewalks, and patios use a lipped edger with a ½” radius. In the case of joints subject to vehicle traffic, use a radius of 1/8”. Before you start edging, for better results, run a pointed trowel along the forms to dislodge the aggregate away from the forms. Then start the first pass with a wide edger (6” Width x 10” Length). Run the edger in a forward and backward motion keeping the leading edge slightly elevated so it does not dig into the surface. Edger will work better if you do not start in a corner and do not lift edger from the surface unless it is in motion. Use a narrow 2 ½” edger for the second pass. Narrow edger’s tend to be a little squirrely, be careful not to dig into surface. Edging may be required after each finishing operation. Walking Edger’s, which have a long handle allows the finisher to stand while edging. Special Edging Tools are available for finishing inside and outside corners of curbs and steps. Joints can be saw cut into slab after it hardens (see Controlling Cracks in Slab on Grade Concrete). For floors that must carry heavy forklift traffic, sawed joints are preferred. Tooled joints are formed in the concrete before it sets using a Grooving Tool. As shown here grooving tools come in many different styles, Hand Groovers, Clip-on Groovers, Torpedo Groovers, Rolling Groovers, and more. To control shrinkage cracks you must use a Grooving Tool that is at least ¼ of the depth of the slab. For Floors the radius of the Grooving Tool should be as tight as possible, no more than 1/8”. For outdoor flatwork a radius of ¼” – ½” in acceptable. To make a grooved joint simply place the Grooving Tool into the concrete, then push the groover while applying pressure to the trailing edge. Use a board or a chalk line to guide the Grooving Tool along its path. Marking the forms prior to the start of the pour will save time and tend to be more accurate. Walking Groover’s are available as well as Grover’s for forming vertical grooves in curbs and steps. On House slabs try to place joints under walls or under carpet areas. Under walls they won’t be seen. Under carpet areas the joints won’t have a chance to telegraph through vinyl or tiled areas. After Strike-Off, Bull Floating or Floating with a Darbie, Edging (if Required), and jointing (If a Grooving Tool is used) the surface is floated a second time. (Only float after the bleedwater has evaporated) The second float removes slight imperfections left in the slab by prior operations, and compacts the mortar at the surface to prepare it for any further finishing if desired. This second float can be complete by hand trowel, or by a machine trowel. Hand Floats come 3” – 4” wide and lengths ranging from 12” – 24”. They come in four flavors Wood, Aluminum, Magnesium, and composite material. Save time and frustration and use a magnesium float. Magnesium floats slide easily across the concrete requiring less effort, and produce a better finish. While floating hold the float flat while sweeping it across the surface in an arc. A float texture has a good non-skid surface. In many instances this texture is used as the final finish for sidewalks, driveways, and patios. If floating is going to be the final surface a second pass with the hand float may be desired. Troweling with a steel trowel is done when a smooth, dense surface is desired, such as a warehouse or garage floor. Troweling is not recommend for external slabs in Florida: add water, a little mold, and someone wearing flip flops and you have an extremely dangerous situation. Be sure the surface has been floated before troweling. Bull floating or darbying alone are not adequate preparation. To save time the finisher can float the slab then trowel it as he moves across the slab on knee boards. During the first troweling use a wide trowel (at least 4 ½” wide) one that has been broken in, or a trowel that has the edges machined to give it a broken in feel. This will allow the finisher to work the trowel flat without digging into the surface. Move the trowel across the slab in a sweeping arc motion, tilting the trowel on slightly to keep the trowel from skipping across the slab. Overlap each pass by at least half of the trowel length this will ensure that the trowel cover the surface twice. To improve surface wear resistance, and smoothness additional troweling may be desired. On later passes use narrow trowels to increase trowel pressure at the surface. Fresnos are large trowels that attach to bull float handles. Fresnos are used for troweling slabs that do not require a hard trowel surface. A Fresnos will speed up the troweling process. Fresnos should not be used as bull floats. Troweling can also be accomplished by machine. Power trowels range in size from small walk-behind machines to larger double or triple rotor ride-on machine. Take care to make sure that all of the blades on a rotor are in the same condition. If one blade is bent or broken, you must change all the blades on the rotor. Brooming the concrete before it hardens will produces a slip-resistant surface. Once the surface has been floated or troweled test a small section to see if the concrete has hardened enough to give you the texture you desire. For best result, use a concrete broom they are specially designed for this purpose. Stiff bristle brooms produce a coarse texture, while a soft bristle brooms will produce a medium to fine texture. Test a small section first to see if it gives you the desired texture. If the broom pulls off to much excess concrete wait a little while and try again. Pull the broom across the slab at a right angle to the main direction of travel.To achieve a texture that is sharp and uniform, keep the bristles clean removing excess concrete as you go. A wide variety of colors, textures, and special techniques can be used to achieve decorative finishes. Here are some ideas however, for most decorative or architectural finishes we recommend that you hire a qualified concrete contractor that specialize in decorative concrete. Ready to order?

      "Home  Skills  Concreting A full day Intermediate $51–100 Family Handyman A darby flattens the wet concrete. Family Handyman An edging tool gives the concrete a round edge. Family Handyman A groover makes joints in the concrete to control cracking. Family Handyman A float compacts the concrete surface, giving it a smooth look. Putting a smooth, durable finish on concrete is a skill you can only master with the proper set of tools and practice. We’ll show you the tools and how to use them for each step of the concrete finishing process. And equally important, we’ll help you determine when the concrete is ready for the next finishing step. But you really can’t practice these techniques except on real concrete. So it’s smart to start with a small project like this garbage can pad. When you get the hang of it, you can move up to a larger slab. But keep in mind that finishing larger slabs (more than about 100 sq. ft.) is trickier because the concrete may set up too fast. In this article, we’ll show you how to level the concrete in the forms, round over the edges and make a progressively smoother finish. But we won’t show how to build forms or fill them with concrete. Each step in the process requires a different tool. You can make the screed (Photo 1) and darby (Photo 2) from scraps of wood. The rest you’ll have to rent or buy. You’ll need a magnesium float ($15 to $25), an edger ($5 to $20), a grooving tool ($10 to $30) and a steel trowel ($8 to $40). Pros buy expensive top-quality tools that will stand up to the rigors of daily use, but less expensive versions are available at home centers and hardware stores and will work fine for occasional home use. Concrete is a blend of Portland cement, sand, aggregate (gravel) and water that harden when mixed. While there are additives that can slow down or speed up the process, and special bagged mixes that set fast, in general, the speed of the process largely depends on the temperature and humidity. Hot, dry weather accelerates the hardening process, sometimes so much that it’s nearly impossible to complete all the finishing steps in time. Work while your project is in shade if possible. On cool days, you may spend a lot of time waiting for the concrete to reach the next stage. That’s why we can’t give you exact waiting times. But we’ll show you how to tell when the concrete is ready for each finishing step. Family Handyman Push or pull the screed board across the forms with a back-and-forth sawing motion. Shove concrete into low spots in front of the screed board. Repeat to remove excess concrete. Form and Pour a Concrete Slab Family Handyman Sweep the darby across the concrete in overlapping arcs to flatten the surface, push down lumps and fill voids. Lift the leading edge slightly but keep the darby level with the surface. Make two passes. How to Pour a Concrete Slab Successfully: 31 Tips Family Handyman Water will appear on the surface. Wait until this “bleed” water and sheen disappear entirely before edging, jointing or floating the concrete. Screeding levels the concrete with the top of the forms and begins the process of forcing the larger aggregate below the surface. Use any 2×4 that overlaps the forms by at least 6 in., but make sure it’s straight (Photo 1). Follow screeding immediately with the darby (Photo 2). Your goal is to level out marks and fill small holes left by screeding. In the process, you’ll force larger aggregate down, leaving a slurry of cement and sand to fill the surface. The darby should be large enough to reach a little more than halfway across the slab. Make a darby by screwing a handle (we cut a 2×4 with a jigsaw to make a handle) onto a straight piece of 1×4. Longer darbies may require two handles for better control. If you can’t reach the entire slab from the edges with a darby, rent a bull float and handle to use instead. Two passes over the surface with the darby are enough. Overworking the concrete will draw too much cement and fine sand to the top and create a weak surface. Drilling Concrete and Installing Fasteners Family Handyman Work the edging tool back and forth, using the edge of the form as a guide. Lift the leading edge slightly. Use long strokes, working the aggregate back until you have smooth, round edges. Family Handyman Set a straight board along predetermined marks for control joints. Run the groover back and forth against the straightedge until the bed of the tool is riding on the concrete surface. After smoothing the slab with the darby, water will “bleed” out of the concrete and sit on the surface (Photo 3). This is temporary. It’ll soon reabsorb into the concrete. However, it’s critical to wait until it disappears. Working the concrete before the surface “bleed” water disappears will weaken the surface of the slab when it dries. When all traces of the water are gone and the concrete starts to harden, you can resume finishing activities. Test by pressing your gloved thumb onto the surface near the perimeter. The concrete is ready when pressing hard only leaves a 1/4-in. deep impression. Start by running the edger around the perimeter to round and compact the corner (Photo 4). Sometimes it’s a little tough at first as you push larger aggregate back into the concrete and round over the edge. If the edger is leaving a path deeper than about 1/8 in., wait for the concrete to set a little longer and apply less downward pressure. Next divide the slab into equal parts with a straightedge and groover (Photo 5). Sidewalks and small slabs need grooves about every 4 ft. Add grooves every 10 or 12 ft. on driveways and garage slabs. Dividing slabs with grooves looks nice, but the real reason is to control cracking. Drying and soil movement cause concrete to crack. The groove creates a weakened spot for the crack to form where it won’t be seen. To be effective, the groove must be at least one-fourth the depth of the slab. Family Handyman Lift the leading edge slightly while you sweep the magnesium concrete hand float over the concrete in large arcs to compact the surface. Blend in the marks left by the edges of the edger and groover. How to Remove and Replace a Small Concrete Entry Pad Family Handyman Smooth the surface with a steel trowel after it’s partially hardened. Hold the trowel almost flat and swing it in large overlapping arcs while applying pressure. Float the concrete when you’re done grooving and edging (Photo 6). Floating removes the marks left by edging and brings the surface one step closer to a final finish. You may have to bear down on the float if the concrete is starting to harden. You’ll be surprised that with enough scrubbing you’ll be able to bring a slurry to the surface of even a fairly hard slab. If you’re happy with the look of your floated slab, you don’t need to do any more finishing. Repeat the edging and grooving steps after floating and after troweling to refine the groove and edges. For a decorative border effect similar to what’s shown in the inset to Photo 4, run the edger around each section of slab after a final broom finish. In Photo 7, we show how to put an even, smooth finish on the slab with a steel trowel. Troweling is one of the trickier steps in concrete finishing. You’ll have to practice to develop a feel for it. For a really smooth finish, repeat the troweling step two or three times, letting the concrete harden a bit between each pass. At first, hold the trowel almost flat, elevating the leading edge just enough to avoid gouging the surface. On each successive pass, lift the leading edge of the trowel a little more. If you want a rougher, non-slip surface, you can skip this step and do a broom finish (Photo 8). Also, if you order air-entrained concrete delivered, don’t trowel the surface. How to Properly Mix Concrete Drag a broom across the concrete after floating it with the magnesium float to create a non-slip surface. Adjust the downward pressure to create the desired amount of texture. Dragging a broom across partially hardened concrete leaves a rough texture that gives better traction in slippery conditions (Photo 8). Special concrete brooms are available, but a regular push broom will work too. Remember to wash off the bristles as soon as you finish brooming concrete. As with all the other finishing steps, the key to a successful broom finish is to wait until the concrete surface is just right. If concrete starts to pile up in front of the bristles as you drag the broom across, resmooth the broomed area with a float or trowel and then wait a little longer before trying again. When you’re done finishing the concrete, cover it with plastic or keep it moist by sprinkling it several times a day for about a week. This slows the curing process and results in a stronger, more durable slab. It might be hard to believe that concrete can be dangerous. But the strong alkalinity of cement can cause chemical burns just like a strong acid. By the time you realize you’re being burned, you may already have skin damage. That’s why it’s essential to prevent prolonged skin exposure to wet concrete. And why you should be extra careful to keep wet concrete from getting in your eyes. Wear rubber gloves, a long-sleeve shirt, long pants and safety glasses. Wear rubber boots if you’ll be wading in concrete. Rinse wet concrete from your skin immediately and remove clothes that have become saturated with concrete.

      "94,250 73 4 Have you ever seen a sidewalk poured with new concrete and watched someone finish the concrete? You probably didn’t pay a lot of attention but you noticed someone down on their hands and knees with a trowel moving around the concrete surface. Like everything else that is done by someone with experience, it looked easy. Guess what? It’s not that easy unless you have done some homework. Sakrete is here to provide you those tips and instructions on how to finish concrete like a pro. After thoroughly mixing the concrete pour it into the forms slightly overfilling them. Then take a straight board (a 2x4 piece of lumber works great as long as it isn’t bowed) and simply level off the concrete. Using a board that is longer than your pour is wide and using a sawing motion work back and forth until the concrete is level. You really need someone on the other side to help with this part. This is called “screeding” if you are trying to learn new words with which to impress your friends. If you haven’t done this before or only done it a few times you are likely to make two mistakes; troweling too soon and troweling too much. Both of these have the effect of pulling fines and water to the surface. This can lead to a weakened surface, tiny cracks and a white dusty surface. Then with a wooden trowel or magnesium float if you want to get fancy, smooth off the surface. This should only take a few minutes. Do not try to turn this into a masterpiece-leave that for art class. This step is simply to put a relatively smooth surface on the concrete. When you are done, go clean your mixer and tools and get something to drink. Keep an eye on the concrete. The first thing you will notice is that some bleed water will come to the surface. This is a good thing. Allow all of the water to disappear before you do anything else. This can take 20 minutes or 4 hours depending on the temperature, humidity and how hard the wind is blowing. After the bleed water is all gone you can get out your steel finishing trowel and put on the final touches. You will notice the steel trowel is not perfectly flat. That is done so that when you trowel you will be more prone to lift the leading edge slightly avoiding digging into the concrete.  Even by following my outstanding instructions it is doubtful that your surface will look a pro did it. As I said in the beginning, using a trowel isn’t all that easy. However, most of us are good with a broom. If your mother brought you up right, you’ve had lots of practice. Once you are finished with the trowel, simply take a soft broom and gently drag it across the surface. Always pull the broom (never push) and always go in the same direction. Just one pass should do the trick. I personally prefer a broom finish because it makes the surface slightly rougher. This is very helpful for those occasions when your sidewalk is wet. A hard troweled surface is very slick. Unless your brother-in-law is a really good lawyer, you don’t want someone take a tumble on your property. Concrete Repair is never fun.  Besides this way everyone will think you really knew what you doing and you won’t have to tell them about the broom trick.  Don’t stop reading yet or you will miss one very important point. You need to “cure” the concrete. If the concrete isn’t kept moist for a few days it may crack. The problem is that the surface will dry out while the bottom is still wet causing tension which basically tears the concrete apart. There are several ways to cure concrete. The easiest is to simply spray it very lightly with a hose. You can cover it with a wet cloth such as burlap (don’t let the burlap dry out). Or you can use chemical curing agents such as Sakrete Cure `N Seal. The question of how long to do this and how often is a tough one because it depends on temperature, humidity and air flow. The hotter and dryer and windier it is the more you will have to re apply water. Bob Schmidt Product Manager Sakrete of North America Did you make this project? Share it with us!                                                                7 years ago                     on Step 4 Thank you for this instructable. I learned not to play with it too much as this what my problem was last time. I am going to have a go at this project again.                                                                10 years ago                     on Introduction At times, I like the \"exposed aggregate look\". But how and when to do this is \" touchy\" no?                                                                12 years ago                     on Introduction Thank you for your series in making concrete projects.  Every now and then someone wants to make a casting project with a concrete and a mold.  Sometimes the \"top\" of the final project will be the shape of the mold (flipped over after curing) and sometimes the top will be the top surface of the dried concrete.  Do you have recommendations for making smooth surfaces when casting flat or curved concrete?  The projects I'm thinking of would be smooth enough to apply wax for a perfect shine.                                                 Reply                                          12 years ago                     on Introduction As you well know concrete mixes are usually very porous once they set and that is mainly due to the gravel aggregate in the mix. The top of the mold area can easily be floated or troweled to a somewhat smooth surface but the bottom of the mold is much harder to control. The aggregate will fall to the bottom of the mold. My suggestion would be to allow for the top of the molded concrete to be the top of the project piece as it is the only side you can consistently control the surface of. If it is necessary for the bottom to be used as the top of the project, you may want to look into using an additional resurfacing material which dosen't contain the large aggregate such as the Sakrete Top N Bond Concrete Patcher. The patcher can be used once the concrete piece is set enough so that it is undisturbed when applying the Top N Bond. Hope this helps..The Sakrete Team © 2023 Autodesk, Inc. \n",

If you are using wheelbarrows to move the concrete from the truck to the forms, make sure you have enough help to finish the project in a timely manner. Concrete delivery should be closely coordinated with placing and finishing operations. Concrete should not be poured faster than it can be worked – spreading, consolidating, bull floating. Instead, concrete should be poured continuously as near as possible to its final position. You should never dump concrete into separate piles and work together. Placing concrete in forms and then consolidating is popular for some types of construction (i.e. Pouring Formed Columns, Beams Etc.). The consolidation process uses vibration and gravity to compact fresh concrete within the forms and around embedded items and reinforcement. This process eliminates unwanted pockets of trapped air, honeycomb, and stone while maintaining significant amounts of entrained air. The vibration temporarily suspends the natural friction between the aggregate particles, causing the concrete to behave as a liquid. Internal friction resumes as the vibration is stopped. Vibrators can be found at most rental supply stores. When pouring concrete into ICF’s (insulating Concrete Forms) we do not recommend using Pencil Vibrators, instead use a wall banger for consolidation. ICF’s are poured in 4’ lifts, if you use a pencil vibrator you risk re-liquefying the lifts below. This will increase the pressure at the bottom of the forms and risk a blow out. Visible concrete slabs used for driveways, patios, etc. will often need finishing. You can finish your concrete in many ways, including color tinting, texturing, and Patterned-stamped finishes. These are considered advanced finishing techniques and will only be covered briefly in this section. Some surfaces may require just strike off and screeding to proper contour and elevation. Others will require a broomed, troweled or floated finish. In this section we will take you step-by-step through the process. Strike off operation is key the achieving a true plane surface. A screed is the tool used to accomplish this task often made of wood (2” x 4” Lumber), magnesium, or aluminum. Because the tool is called a screed this process is often referred to as screeding. “Screeding” is most commonly used word to describe this process in this area. Screeding is the process of cutting off excess concrete to bring the top surface of the slab to proper grade. The screed should be 1 1/2’ – 2’ longer than the slab is wide so that it always rides on the forms. A straight edge is moved across the concrete with a sawing motion and progresses forward a short distance with each movement. The screed should be tilted slightly toward the operator so that there is a single cutting edge. To fill in low points keep approximately 1 inch of concrete rolling in front of the straight edge. Remove excess concrete with a flat shovel or a hoe-like tool called a come-along. Frequently two passes with the screed is necessary to achieve desired grade. If you are going to be pouring a large slab with a width of 15’ feet or greater it becomes difficult to strike off this much concrete. Even at fifteen feet you will need three people working the screed. At this point instead of relying solely on the side forms temporary pipe, or rails can be used. The use of grade stakes placed throughout the pouring area will help give the crew reference points to level the slab as they go. If you drive the grade stakes in far enough to accommodate the temporary rail and still be at desired grade this system works very well. Use metal grade stakes so you can pull them up or bend them over as they are no longer need. I have seen many crews that have been pouring for years only use grade stakes and forgo the rails. There are hand-drawn and power drawn vibrating screeds that can be used to strike off and consolidate the concrete at the same time. They can be ordered with single beam, double beam, or truss type straight edges. Bull Floats and darbies serve the same purpose however, daries are typically use for small areas. Both are used to eliminates high and low spots, and to slightly embed large aggregate particles immediately after strike off. These floats will also work up more paste to the top of the slab to help in finishing later. Bull floats are large, long handled floats that are used while standing. There long extendable handles are used for reaching across large slabs. Bull Float blades are usually 8” wide and 3’ – 8’ long and come with a fix head or pivoting head. Fix head bull floats require the finished to lower the handle thus lifting the front of the blade as he pushes it across the surface, then he must lift the handle to raise the other side of the blade on the return. The distance that the float can effectively be used is limit by the reach of the finisher. The alternative is using a pivoting blade head. By rotating the handle the finisher can raise and lower the blade allowing the finisher to reach much farther. (Note: when adding on additional screw in handles to reach farther distances beware of overhead power lines) Darbies are held in the hand, while the finisher kneels on knee boards. Darbies range in length from 28” – 45” long, and the width tapers from 2 ½” – 3 ½” at the handle. The longer Darbies will have two or three handles for better control. Bull Floats are made of Wood, Aluminum, or Magnesium. Darbies are made of wood and Magnesium. Wood Darbies and Bull Floats are used on slab that are not air-entrained or slab that have slumps of less than 4”. The wood grains texture makes them least likely to seal the surface before bleedwater has a chance to bleed off and dissipate.  Start bull floating or using the darbie immediately after the strike-off and finish before the bleed water appears. If possible have a finisher follow the strike-off crew with the bull float. If you are limited on help, stop every few yards and bull float the slab as you go. When bull floating pass the float across the slab perpendicular to the direction of the strike-off. Keep the leading edge of the bull float slightly elevated so that it does not dig in to the slab. Avoid creating high spots near the edge of the forms by bring the bull float blade all the way to the edge of the form. Use a hand held float to go back and float around the edges. If low spots remain add concrete to that area and float again. Note: Do not over float the surface. Do not slop the cream off the sides of the forms: you will need this later for finishing. When using the Darbie, hold it flat against the surface and work in a sawing motion across the slab. Keep Darbie as flat as possible to keep from sealing the surface. When the surface is level, tilt the Darbie slightly and sweep it across the surface to fill small impressions left by the sawing motion. You do not need to wait for bleed water to evaporate on the first pass of the Bull Float or Darbie. On some slabs all that may be required is one pass of the bull float; however on most slabs additional finishing will be required.  Before any further finishing is started, the finisher must wait for the bleedwater to evaporate. Finishing while bleedwater is present can cause crazing, dusting, or scaling. Sprinkling water on top of the slab or adding straight Portland to the surface to dry up water will also cause serious problems. Don’t start to finish until, when you push on the surface with your finger you only leave a ¼” deep impression. Edging is usually only needed on sidewalks, driveways and steps. Edging is not required on slabs, and should not be done on floors that will be covered with tile. Edging will compact the concrete next to the form where floating and troweling are less effective. This will make the edge of the slab more durable and less likely to chip. Edging tools have a curved lip that forms the edge. These curved lips range in depth from 1/8” -1 ½” and in radius from 1/8” – 1”. For Driveway, sidewalks, and patios use a lipped edger with a ½” radius. In the case of joints subject to vehicle traffic, use a radius of 1/8”. Before you start edging, for better results, run a pointed trowel along the forms to dislodge the aggregate away from the forms. Then start the first pass with a wide edger (6” Width x 10” Length). Run the edger in a forward and backward motion keeping the leading edge slightly elevated so it does not dig into the surface. Edger will work better if you do not start in a corner and do not lift edger from the surface unless it is in motion. Use a narrow 2 ½” edger for the second pass. Narrow edger’s tend to be a little squirrely, be careful not to dig into surface. Edging may be required after each finishing operation. Walking Edger’s, which have a long handle allows the finisher to stand while edging. Special Edging Tools are available for finishing inside and outside corners of curbs and steps. Joints can be saw cut into slab after it hardens (see Controlling Cracks in Slab on Grade Concrete). For floors that must carry heavy forklift traffic, sawed joints are preferred. Tooled joints are formed in the concrete before it sets using a Grooving Tool. As shown here grooving tools come in many different styles, Hand Groovers, Clip-on Groovers, Torpedo Groovers, Rolling Groovers, and more. To control shrinkage cracks you must use a Grooving Tool that is at least ¼ of the depth of the slab. For Floors the radius of the Grooving Tool should be as tight as possible, no more than 1/8”. For outdoor flatwork a radius of ¼” – ½” in acceptable. To make a grooved joint simply place the Grooving Tool into the concrete, then push the groover while applying pressure to the trailing edge. Use a board or a chalk line to guide the Grooving Tool along its path. Marking the forms prior to the start of the pour will save time and tend to be more accurate. Walking Groover’s are available as well as Grover’s for forming vertical grooves in curbs and steps. On House slabs try to place joints under walls or under carpet areas. Under walls they won’t be seen. Under carpet areas the joints won’t have a chance to telegraph through vinyl or tiled areas. After Strike-Off, Bull Floating or Floating with a Darbie, Edging (if Required), and jointing (If a Grooving Tool is used) the surface is floated a second time. (Only float after the bleedwater has evaporated) The second float removes slight imperfections left in the slab by prior operations, and compacts the mortar at the surface to prepare it for any further finishing if desired. This second float can be complete by hand trowel, or by a machine trowel. Hand Floats come 3” – 4” wide and lengths ranging from 12” – 24”. They come in four flavors Wood, Aluminum, Magnesium, and composite material. Save time and frustration and use a magnesium float. Magnesium floats slide easily across the concrete requiring less effort, and produce a better finish. While floating hold the float flat while sweeping it across the surface in an arc. A float texture has a good non-skid surface. In many instances this texture is used as the final finish for sidewalks, driveways, and patios. If floating is going to be the final surface a second pass with the hand float may be desired. Troweling with a steel trowel is done when a smooth, dense surface is desired, such as a warehouse or garage floor. Troweling is not recommend for external slabs in Florida: add water, a little mold, and someone wearing flip flops and you have an extremely dangerous situation. Be sure the surface has been floated before troweling. Bull floating or darbying alone are not adequate preparation. To save time the finisher can float the slab then trowel it as he moves across the slab on knee boards. During the first troweling use a wide trowel (at least 4 ½” wide) one that has been broken in, or a trowel that has the edges machined to give it a broken in feel. This will allow the finisher to work the trowel flat without digging into the surface. Move the trowel across the slab in a sweeping arc motion, tilting the trowel on slightly to keep the trowel from skipping across the slab. Overlap each pass by at least half of the trowel length this will ensure that the trowel cover the surface twice. To improve surface wear resistance, and smoothness additional troweling may be desired. On later passes use narrow trowels to increase trowel pressure at the surface. Fresnos are large trowels that attach to bull float handles. Fresnos are used for troweling slabs that do not require a hard trowel surface. A Fresnos will speed up the troweling process. Fresnos should not be used as bull floats. Troweling can also be accomplished by machine. Power trowels range in size from small walk-behind machines to larger double or triple rotor ride-on machine. Take care to make sure that all of the blades on a rotor are in the same condition. If one blade is bent or broken, you must change all the blades on the rotor. Brooming the concrete before it hardens will produces a slip-resistant surface. Once the surface has been floated or troweled test a small section to see if the concrete has hardened enough to give you the texture you desire. For best result, use a concrete broom they are specially designed for this purpose. Stiff bristle brooms produce a coarse texture, while a soft bristle brooms will produce a medium to fine texture. Test a small section first to see if it gives you the desired texture. If the broom pulls off to much excess concrete wait a little while and try again. Pull the broom across the slab at a right angle to the main direction of travel.To achieve a texture that is sharp and uniform, keep the bristles clean removing excess concrete as you go. A wide variety of colors, textures, and special techniques can be used to achieve decorative finishes. Here are some ideas however, for most decorative or architectural finishes we recommend that you hire a qualified concrete contractor that specialize in decorative concrete. Ready to order?

Family Handyman A groover makes joints in the concrete to control cracking. Family Handyman A float compacts the concrete surface, giving it a smooth look.\\xa0Putting a smooth, durable finish on concrete is a skill you can only master with the proper set of tools and practice. We’ll show you the tools and how to use them for each step of the concrete finishing process. And equally important, we’ll help you determine when the concrete is ready for the next finishing step. But you really can’t practice these techniques except on real concrete. So it’s smart to start with a small project like this garbage can pad. When you get the hang of it, you can move up to a larger slab. But keep in mind that finishing larger slabs (more than about 100 sq. ft.) is trickier because the concrete may set up too fast. In this article, we’ll show you how to level the concrete in the forms, round over the edges and make a progressively smoother finish. But we won’t show how to build forms or fill them with concrete. Each step in the process requires a different tool. You can make the screed (Photo 1) and darby (Photo 2) from scraps of wood. The rest you’ll have to rent or buy. You’ll need a magnesium float ($15 to $25), an edger ($5 to $20), a grooving tool ($10 to $30) and a steel trowel ($8 to $40). Pros buy expensive top-quality tools that will stand up to the rigors of daily use, but less expensive versions are available at home centers and hardware stores and will work fine for occasional home use. Concrete is a blend of Portland cement, sand, aggregate (gravel) and water that harden when mixed. While there are additives that can slow down or speed up the process, and special bagged mixes that set fast, in general, the speed of the process largely depends on the temperature and humidity. Hot, dry weather accelerates the hardening process, sometimes so much that it’s nearly impossible to complete all the finishing steps in time. Work while your project is in shade if possible. On cool days, you may spend a lot of time waiting for the concrete to reach the next stage. That’s why we can’t give you exact waiting times. But we’ll show you how to tell when the concrete is ready for each finishing step. Family Handyman Push or pull the screed board across the forms with a back-and-forth sawing motion. Shove concrete into low spots in front of the screed board. Repeat to remove excess concrete. Form and Pour a Concrete Slab Family Handyman Sweep the darby across the concrete in overlapping arcs to flatten the surface, push down lumps and fill voids. Lift the leading edge slightly but keep the darby level with the surface. Make two passes. How to Pour a Concrete Slab Successfully: 31 Tips Family Handyman Water will appear on the surface. Wait until this “bleed” water and sheen disappear entirely before edging, jointing or floating the concrete.\\xa0Screeding levels the concrete with the top of the forms and begins the process of forcing the larger aggregate below the surface. Use any 2×4 that overlaps the forms by at least 6 in., but make sure it’s straight (Photo 1). Follow screeding immediately with the darby (Photo 2). Your goal is to level out marks and fill small holes left by screeding. In the process, you’ll force larger aggregate down, leaving a slurry of cement and sand to fill the surface. The darby should be large enough to reach a little more than halfway across the slab. Make a darby by screwing a handle (we cut a 2×4 with a jigsaw to make a handle) onto a straight piece of 1×4. Longer darbies may require two handles for better control. If you can’t reach the entire slab from the edges with a darby, rent a bull float and handle to use instead. Two passes over the surface with the darby are enough. Overworking the concrete will draw too much cement and fine sand to the top and create a weak surface. Drilling Concrete and Installing Fasteners Family Handyman Work the edging tool back and forth, using the edge of the form as a guide. Lift the leading edge slightly. Use long strokes, working the aggregate back until you have smooth, round edges. Family Handyman Set a straight board along predetermined marks for control joints. Run the groover back and forth against the straightedge until the bed of the tool is riding on the concrete surface.\\xa0After smoothing the slab with the darby, water will “bleed” out of the concrete and sit on the surface (Photo 3). This is temporary. It’ll soon reabsorb into the concrete. However, it’s critical to wait until it disappears. Working the concrete before the surface “bleed” water disappears will weaken the surface of the slab when it dries. When all traces of the water are gone and the concrete starts to harden, you can resume finishing activities. Test by pressing your gloved thumb onto the surface near the perimeter. The concrete is ready when pressing hard only leaves a 1/4-in. deep impression. Start by running the edger around the perimeter to round and compact the corner (Photo 4). Sometimes it’s a little tough at first as you push larger aggregate back into the concrete and round over the edge. If the edger is leaving a path deeper than about 1/8 in., wait for the concrete to set a little longer and apply less downward pressure. Next divide the slab into equal parts with a straightedge and groover (Photo 5). Sidewalks and small slabs need grooves about every 4 ft. Add grooves every 10 or 12 ft. on driveways and garage slabs. Dividing slabs with grooves looks nice, but the real reason is to control cracking. Drying and soil movement cause concrete to crack. The groove creates a weakened spot for the crack to form where it won’t be seen. To be effective, the groove must be at least one-fourth the depth of the slab. Family Handyman Lift the leading edge slightly while you sweep the magnesium concrete hand float over the concrete in large arcs to compact the surface. Blend in the marks left by the edges of the edger and groover. How to Remove and Replace a Small Concrete Entry Pad Family Handyman Smooth the surface with a steel trowel after it’s partially hardened. Hold the trowel almost flat and swing it in large overlapping arcs while applying pressure.\\xa0Float the concrete when you’re done grooving and edging (Photo 6). Floating removes the marks left by edging and brings the surface one step closer to a final finish. You may have to bear down on the float if the concrete is starting to harden. You’ll be surprised that with enough scrubbing you’ll be able to bring a slurry to the surface of even a fairly hard slab. If you’re happy with the look of your floated slab, you don’t need to do any more finishing. Repeat the edging and grooving steps after floating and after troweling to refine the groove and edges. For a decorative border effect similar to what’s shown in the inset to Photo 4, run the edger around each section of slab after a final broom finish. In Photo 7, we show how to put an even, smooth finish on the slab with a steel trowel. Troweling is one of the trickier steps in concrete finishing. You’ll have to practice to develop a feel for it. For a really smooth finish, repeat the troweling step two or three times, letting the concrete harden a bit between each pass. At first, hold the trowel almost flat, elevating the leading edge just enough to avoid gouging the surface. On each successive pass, lift the leading edge of the trowel a little more. If you want a rougher, non-slip surface, you can skip this step and do a broom finish (Photo 8). Also, if you order air-entrained concrete delivered, don’t trowel the surface. How to Properly Mix Concrete Drag a broom across the concrete after floating it with the magnesium float to create a non-slip surface. Adjust the downward pressure to create the desired amount of texture.\\xa0Dragging a broom across partially hardened concrete leaves a rough texture that gives better traction in slippery conditions (Photo 8). Special concrete brooms are available, but a regular push broom will work too. Remember to wash off the bristles as soon as you finish brooming concrete. As with all the other finishing steps, the key to a successful broom finish is to wait until the concrete surface is just right. If concrete starts to pile up in front of the bristles as you drag the broom across, resmooth the broomed area with a float or trowel and then wait a little longer before trying again. When you’re done finishing the concrete, cover it with plastic or keep it moist by sprinkling it several times a day for about a week. This slows the curing process and results in a stronger, more durable slab. It might be hard to believe that concrete can be dangerous. But the strong alkalinity of cement can cause chemical burns just like a strong acid. By the time you realize you’re being burned, you may already have skin damage. That’s why it’s essential to prevent prolonged skin exposure to wet concrete. And why you should be extra careful to keep wet concrete from getting in your eyes. Wear rubber gloves, a long-sleeve shirt, long pants and safety glasses. Wear rubber boots if you’ll be wading in concrete. Rinse wet concrete from your skin immediately and remove clothes that have become saturated with concrete.

Lift the leading edge slightly but keep the darby level with the surface. Make two passes. How to Pour a Concrete Slab Successfully: 31 Tips Family Handyman Water will appear on the surface. Wait until this “bleed” water and sheen disappear entirely before edging, jointing or floating the concrete.\\xa0Screeding levels the concrete with the top of the forms and begins the process of forcing the larger aggregate below the surface. Use any 2×4 that overlaps the forms by at least 6 in., but make sure it’s straight (Photo 1). Follow screeding immediately with the darby (Photo 2). Your goal is to level out marks and fill small holes left by screeding. In the process, you’ll force larger aggregate down, leaving a slurry of cement and sand to fill the surface. The darby should be large enough to reach a little more than halfway across the slab. Make a darby by screwing a handle (we cut a 2×4 with a jigsaw to make a handle) onto a straight piece of 1×4. Longer darbies may require two handles for better control. If you can’t reach the entire slab from the edges with a darby, rent a bull float and handle to use instead. Two passes over the surface with the darby are enough. Overworking the concrete will draw too much cement and fine sand to the top and create a weak surface. Drilling Concrete and Installing Fasteners Family Handyman Work the edging tool back and forth, using the edge of the form as a guide. Lift the leading edge slightly. Use long strokes, working the aggregate back until you have smooth, round edges. Family Handyman Set a straight board along predetermined marks for control joints. Run the groover back and forth against the straightedge until the bed of the tool is riding on the concrete surface.\\xa0After smoothing the slab with the darby, water will “bleed” out of the concrete and sit on the surface (Photo 3). This is temporary. It’ll soon reabsorb into the concrete. However, it’s critical to wait until it disappears. Working the concrete before the surface “bleed” water disappears will weaken the surface of the slab when it dries. When all traces of the water are gone and the concrete starts to harden, you can resume finishing activities. Test by pressing your gloved thumb onto the surface near the perimeter. The concrete is ready when pressing hard only leaves a 1/4-in. deep impression. Start by running the edger around the perimeter to round and compact the corner (Photo 4). Sometimes it’s a little tough at first as you push larger aggregate back into the concrete and round over the edge. If the edger is leaving a path deeper than about 1/8 in., wait for the concrete to set a little longer and apply less downward pressure. Next divide the slab into equal parts with a straightedge and groover (Photo 5). Sidewalks and small slabs need grooves about every 4 ft. Add grooves every 10 or 12 ft. on driveways and garage slabs. Dividing slabs with grooves looks nice, but the real reason is to control cracking. Drying and soil movement cause concrete to crack. The groove creates a weakened spot for the crack to form where it won’t be seen. To be effective, the groove must be at least one-fourth the depth of the slab. Family Handyman Lift the leading edge slightly while you sweep the magnesium concrete hand float over the concrete in large arcs to compact the surface. Blend in the marks left by the edges of the edger and groover. How to Remove and Replace a Small Concrete Entry Pad Family Handyman Smooth the surface with a steel trowel after it’s partially hardened. Hold the trowel almost flat and swing it in large overlapping arcs while applying pressure.\\xa0Float the concrete when you’re done grooving and edging (Photo 6). Floating removes the marks left by edging and brings the surface one step closer to a final finish. You may have to bear down on the float if the concrete is starting to harden. You’ll be surprised that with enough scrubbing you’ll be able to bring a slurry to the surface of even a fairly hard slab. If you’re happy with the look of your floated slab, you don’t need to do any more finishing. Repeat the edging and grooving steps after floating and after troweling to refine the groove and edges. For a decorative border effect similar to what’s shown in the inset to Photo 4, run the edger around each section of slab after a final broom finish. In Photo 7, we show how to put an even, smooth finish on the slab with a steel trowel. Troweling is one of the trickier steps in concrete finishing. You’ll have to practice to develop a feel for it. For a really smooth finish, repeat the troweling step two or three times, letting the concrete harden a bit between each pass. At first, hold the trowel almost flat, elevating the leading edge just enough to avoid gouging the surface. On each successive pass, lift the leading edge of the trowel a little more. If you want a rougher, non-slip surface, you can skip this step and do a broom finish (Photo 8). Also, if you order air-entrained concrete delivered, don’t trowel the surface. How to Properly Mix Concrete Drag a broom across the concrete after floating it with the magnesium float to create a non-slip surface. Adjust the downward pressure to create the desired amount of texture.\\xa0Dragging a broom across partially hardened concrete leaves a rough texture that gives better traction in slippery conditions (Photo 8). Special concrete brooms are available, but a regular push broom will work too. Remember to wash off the bristles as soon as you finish brooming concrete. As with all the other finishing steps, the key to a successful broom finish is to wait until the concrete surface is just right. If concrete starts to pile up in front of the bristles as you drag the broom across, resmooth the broomed area with a float or trowel and then wait a little longer before trying again. When you’re done finishing the concrete, cover it with plastic or keep it moist by sprinkling it several times a day for about a week. This slows the curing process and results in a stronger, more durable slab. It might be hard to believe that concrete can be dangerous. But the strong alkalinity of cement can cause chemical burns just like a strong acid. By the time you realize you’re being burned, you may already have skin damage. That’s why it’s essential to prevent prolonged skin exposure to wet concrete. And why you should be extra careful to keep wet concrete from getting in your eyes. Wear rubber gloves, a long-sleeve shirt, long pants and safety glasses. Wear rubber boots if you’ll be wading in concrete. Rinse wet concrete from your skin immediately and remove clothes that have become saturated with concrete.
